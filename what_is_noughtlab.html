                <p>Instead of having just a diary, we have this space and our diary. This is where all of our refined ideas, mistakes, and learnings will be on display—for us to share and for you to explore.</p>

                <p>The whole notion behind having a page like this is to leave our little footprint on the internet. We are lifelong learners, still preparing for our first project, and have stumbled upon a lot of content and websites like these from where we started stitching our dreams. Through NoughtLab, we are attempting to build something similar—something useful for us.</p>
                
                <p>Documenting our projects, book notes, thoughts, and everything else, this is our home on the internet. This is NoughtLab.</p>
